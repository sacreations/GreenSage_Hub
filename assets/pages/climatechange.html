            Climate change refers to the long-term alteration of temperature and typical weather patterns in a place. It can be caused by natural factors such as volcanic eruptions and solar radiation, but human activities are the primary contributors to the current changes in the Earth's climate. The burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which trap heat and lead to global warming. The consequences of climate change include rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems and agriculture. To mitigate these impacts, individuals, communities, and governments must take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, transition to renewable energy sources, and adapt to the changing climate.
